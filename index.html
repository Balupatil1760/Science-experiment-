        Science is very practical oriented. Nothing of rattofying or just plain memorizing. Understand the science behind anything and the agic starts to happen. It just describes stuff happening all around us. Day-in and out we see things but are unable to make a connect and understand, Thats where the bridge grows and kids start loosing interest. The experiments mentioned here can be just done with household items and no extra investment apart from their valuable time. Amaze your kids by getting them do these experiments and let them get a flare of understanding.
        </p>
       
        <p>
        There are various topics of interest like magnetism, electricity, weather, water, astronomy, light, physics, plants and the list can be very exhaustive. Get to know your kids interest of topic but beware safety comes first. So just let kids be safe with wearing appropriate goggles, gloves or aprons as needed. The kids needs to be supervised at all times and pay close attention to what they are doing. They needed full attention of a parent or tutor and be kind enough to experiment with them. </p>
        <p>Let them create a mess, they are learning. Let them get dirty, they are understanding. Let them be impatient, they are curiuos. Let them be them and do not hurry or rush. Let them take their own seet time and you will see amazing differnce within your kids in a short span of time</p>
